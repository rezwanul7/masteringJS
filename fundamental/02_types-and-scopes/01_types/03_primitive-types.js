//There are 5 data types which are used to define primitive values

//Boolean DT
//true, false

//Number DT - integers, floating points including 3 special number values (NaN -Infinity Infinity)
// -3, 3.5, NaN, -Infinity, Infinity are values of Number Data Type

//String DT
// "abcd", "true", "false", "3" ,"-3.4" , "" - empty string values

//null DT
//null - is the one & only value of null data type
let cart = null; //we use null to explicitly declare emptiness of a binding

//undefined DT
//undefined - is the one & only value of undefined data type

let x; //the value of an uninitialized binding x is undefined (DT is also undefined)
